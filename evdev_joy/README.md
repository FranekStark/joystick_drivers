evdev_joy
============================================================
This ROS-Node is uses the evdev through libevdev, to get events from the joystick.
Because of the possibility to configure and map the input events, you can use not only
Joystiks with this node: Every evdev-device, which has buttons/keys and absolute axes
could be used as an input.
